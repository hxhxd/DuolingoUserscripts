# Userscripts

Just a few userscripts I made to test the capabilities of the DuolingoHelper that I made (also for my own enjoyment and because I find them useful). Hopefully this will encourage others to create useful userscripts!

## [Notes Indicator](#notes-indicator)

Notes is one of the most useful features on Duolingo, but sometimes they can be hard to find. But not with the amazing Notes Indicator 3000! All skills with notes get an icon in the top left corner, making it easy to see where to go to get more information about a subject! What's more, click on the icon and a popup with the information from the notes will appear!

## [Skill Hider](#skill-hider)
Sometimes it can be hard to find which skills you need to practice in order to improve, especially now that skill strength is no longer visible ([more on that later!](#strength-viewer)). However, with the Skill Hider (Tree Trimmer would have been better, but I'm committed now), it becomes a lot easier! With just a click of the button, you strong skills will disappear from the tree, and only the weak will remain!

## [Strength Viewer](#strength-viewer)
One of the best features of Duolingo was the ability to view your skill strength and know what to study (still think it was a mistake to remove that). Now, with the Strength Viewer, you too can re-experience the joy of being nagged at about which skills to focus on! (not as pretty though...)

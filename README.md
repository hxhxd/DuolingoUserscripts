# Userscripts

Just a few userscripts I made to test the capabilities of the DuolingoHelper that I made (also for my own enjoyment and because I find them useful). Hopefully this will encourage others to create useful userscripts!

## [Notes Indicator](#notes-indicator)

Notes is one of the most useful features on Duolingo, but sometimes they can be hard to find. But not with the amazing Notes Indicator 3000! All skills with notes get an icon in the top left corner, making it easy to see where to go to get more information about a subject! What's more, click on the icon and a popup with the information from the notes will appear!

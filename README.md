# [Userscripts](#userscripts)

Just a few userscripts I made to test the capabilities of the DuolingoHelper that I made (also for my own enjoyment and because I find them useful). The scripts are even designed to work together! Hopefully this will encourage others to create useful userscripts!

## [Notes Indicator](#notes-indicator)
### [Install](https://github.com/x-inkfish-x/DuolingoUserscripts/raw/master/NotesIndicator.user.js)
Notes is one of the most useful features on Duolingo, but sometimes they can be hard to find. But not with the amazing Notes Indicator 3000! All skills with notes get an icon in the top left corner, making it easy to see where to go to get more information about a subject! What's more, click on the icon and a popup with the information from the notes will appear! (You can also look ahead at future lessons, if that's your thing)

## [Skill Hider](#skill-hider)
### [Install](https://github.com/x-inkfish-x/DuolingoUserscripts/raw/master/SkillHider.user.js)
Sometimes it can be hard to find which skills you need to practice in order to improve, especially now that skill strength is no longer visible ([more on that later!](#strength-viewer)). However, with the Skill Hider (Tree Trimmer would have been better, but I'm committed now), it becomes a lot easier! With just a click of the button, you strong skills will disappear from the tree, and only the weak will remain!

## [Strength Viewer](#strength-viewer)
### [Install](https://github.com/x-inkfish-x/DuolingoUserscripts/raw/master/SkillStrengthViewer.user.js)
One of the best features of Duolingo was the ability to view your skill strength and know what to study (still think it was a mistake to remove that). Now, with the Strength Viewer, you too can re-experience the joy of being nagged at about which skills to focus on! (not as pretty though...)

## [Vocabulary Viewer](#vocabulary-viewer)
### [Install](https://github.com/x-inkfish-x/DuolingoUserscripts/raw/master/SkillVocabularyViewer.user.js)
Another thing that we had once upon a time, but was removed, was the ability to view the vocabulary we had acquired. With the vocabulary viewer, you get a &#x24cc; icon at the top right corner of the skill, and if you click on it you can see the vocabulary that is associated with the lesson!

## [Postscript](#postscript)
If you have come this far, thank you for reading about my scripts! I hope you found at least one that interests you. It's been a really interesting learning experience writing these, and I've personally found a lot of use for all of them. 

I'll do my best to maintain these in the future, but my hope is that they will work with minimal maintenance as long as DuolingoHelper is kept up to date. 

If you have any suggestions for how to improme my scripts, or some other scripts to add, please don't hesitate to give me a shout! (although, if you are a developer/curious about JavaScript, I would encourage you to write your own)
